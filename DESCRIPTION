Description: Provide methods to perform customized inference at individual level by taking 
	contextual covariates into account. Three main functions are provided 
	in this package: (i) LASER(): it generates specially-designed artificial relevant 
	samples for a given case; (ii) g2l.proc(): computes customized fdr(z|x); and (iii) 
	rEB.proc(): performs empirical Bayes inference based on LASERs. The details can be 
	found in Mukhopadhyay, S., and Wang, K (2021, <arXiv:2004.09588>).
